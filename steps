3- in your favorite linux distro install git program.
4- then excute these commands from your shell:
	a. in your prefered directory run this command:
		git clone https://github.com/majed316/simple.git
	b. a directory named simple will be created in that directory.
		"this is our project directory which we will work in"
	c. do this couple of command to identify your self to git 	
	program:
		git config user.name "your github username"
		git config user.email "your githun email"

	you can start to edit or add or delete files. and after you did 
	that to the level you feel you changes are deployable you need 
	to fire up these command to deploy the changes to the master 
	repository in github:
